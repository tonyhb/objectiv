### Objectiv

Ojectiv's aim is to provide a dead-easy content manager for clients and
designers, and leave the developers to the complex stuff.

It's simple: create a basic HTML website with some lorem ipsum, upload it to
Objectiv and edit all of the content immediately. No fussing with CMS or
template langagues (leave that DSL at home, yo) - just point and go.
